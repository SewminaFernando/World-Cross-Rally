<h1>World Cross Rally Championship</h1>

This project is about to create GUI application using Java FX for a World Rally Cross Championship Management System.

<h3>Features of the System</h3>

| Feature | Detailed content |
|---|---|
| Adding driver details | System allows the user to enter the following details by prompting the required information. <br> Name, age, team, car, current points  <br>  <em>Example: Travis Pastrana, 38, Subaru Motorsports, Subaru WRX STi, 10</em> |
| Deleting driver details | System allows the user to delete a driver by searching by name. |
| Updating driver details | System allows the user to update driver details by searching by name. |
| Viewing the rally cross standings | System displays the championship standings ordered by points in descending order. |
| Simulating a random race | System simulates a random race and assigns points to each driver accordingly.  <ul><li>First place gets 10 points</li> <li>Second place gets 8 points</li> <li>Third place gets 5 points</li> </ul> A position is assigned to all the drivers in the driver list. Details about the races are stored in a text file and loaded automatically when the program starts. A race has the following details. <ul><li>Date of the race</li> <li>Location of the race</li> <li>Each driver's position and points</li> </ul> |
| Viewing race table sorted according to the date | System displays all the races in the championship sorted according to the date. (Used Bubble Sorting Algorithm.) |
| Save the current data to a text file | System ables to save the current data to a text file in a way that the data can be retrieved easily. |
| Load data from the saved text file | System should be able to load the current data from the text file to enable resume capabilities. |

<h3>Skills developed by undertaking this project : </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate competence in the algorithmic approach to problem solving.</li>
  <li>Design, code, compile, test and execute fundamental programming concepts using a high level programming language.</li>
  <li>Construct robust, maintainable programs that use object-orientated analysis and design principles.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This user-friendly UI platform can easily be accessible to any function with just one click by 
making it efficient to use. In the program Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts have 
been implemented to ensure the platform is highly adaptable and extendable. By using OOP 
concepts. This makes it easy to add new functionalities or modify existing ones without 
impacting the overall system. OOP allows for easy customization of the user interface and 
promotes code reusability.
